A multi-threaded C program to transform any matrix into their Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) using the Gauss-Jordan Method.  
Suitable for Linear Algebra.

# Features
- Parallel Programming -> Multi Threading
- OpenMP library
- Customizable matrix dimension (Row and column)
- User input elements
- Gauss-Jordan Method implementation
- Steps are shown alongside the thread number used
- Detects the amount of your CPU threads automatically using omp_get_max_threads()  
# Warning
English and Indonesian languages are used.  
Terms translation (Indonesian to English): 
- BEBT = RREF / Reduced Row Echelon Form
- Baris = Row
- Kolom = Column
- Elemen = Element
- Awal = Initial
